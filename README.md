# Cryptography first project
The current project is a efficiency comparative between some encryption algorithms.
The algorithms on this project are:
- AES-EBC 
- AES-CBC 
- SHA-1 
- SHA-2 
- SHA-3
- RSA-OAEP
- RSA-PSS
- DSA 
- ECDSA

Such algorithms has been classified based on some operations:
- Encryption
- Decryption
- Hashing
- Signing
- Verifying
